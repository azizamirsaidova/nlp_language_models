# nlp_language_models

For this homework, we used Pytorch and NLTK library to build different neural netowork models for natural language processing using ```WikiText-2``` database.

## RNN

To run the RNN model for Question 2, the file ```main_RNN``` has to be executed, which will call other files like vocabulary_RNN and import_data_RNN to run correctly.


## LSTM
