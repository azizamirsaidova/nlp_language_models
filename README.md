# nlp_language_models

For this homework, we used Pytorch and NLTK libraries to build different neural network models for natural language processing using ```WikiText-2``` database.

## RNN

To run the RNN model for Question 2, the file ```main_RNN``` has to be executed, which will call other files like ```vocabulary_RNN``` and ```import_data_RNN``` to run correctly.

To run the RNN model incorporating the bonus task, the file ```bonus_RNN``` has to be executed, and will run again the same model but with some functions implemented manually, as softmax, logits and negative log-probabilities.


## LSTM
