# nlp_language_models

For this homework, we used Pytorch and NLTK libraries to build different neural network models for natural language processing using ```WikiText-2``` database.

## RNN

To run the RNN model for Question 2, the file ```main_RNN.py``` has to be executed, which will call other files like ```vocabulary_RNN``` and ```import_data_RNN``` to run correctly.


## LSTM

Similarly to run Question 3 LSTM model, the file ```main_LSTM.py``` has to be executed.
LSTM model can be also executed using colab link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_Et2rmyNZ5F-YeKrB7dPHzXPb1SRgNRo

## Bonus 

To run the RNN,LSTM models incorporating the bonus task, the file ```bonus_RNN.py``` and ```bonus_LSTM.py``` needs to be executed, and will run again the same models but with some functions implemented manually such as the softmax, logits and negative log-probabilities.
